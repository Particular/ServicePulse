## Setting up javascript unit tests

### Running the tests in npm

We are using npm, jasmine and karma to run our tests. First that one need to do to run unit tests is:
 - run `npm install` in the ServicePulse.Host.Test folder
 - run `npm test` that will run headless chrome to execute the test
    - if a need arise to run test on firefox there is a command `npm run test-firefox`
